if data is on remote host, use forwarder to send data to this instance.

The process of transforming the data is called indexing
During indexing, the incoming data is processed to enable fast searching and analysis. The processed results are stored in the index as events.

The index is a flat file repository for the data. For this tutorial, the index resides on the computer where you access the Splunk platform.

Events are stored in the index as a group of files that fall into two categories:

 Raw data, which is the data that you add to the Splunk platform. The raw data is stored in a compressed format.
 Index files, which include some metadata files that point to the raw data.
These files reside in sets of directories, called buckets, that are organized by age.

By default, all of your data is put into a single, preconfigured index. There are several other indexes used for internal purposes.

Statistics: stats, top, chart
